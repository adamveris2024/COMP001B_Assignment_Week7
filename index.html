        <h1>COMP001B | Q&A</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
            <p>I feel like having a small class definitely helped, it let us have a more personal experience with the teacher.</p>

            <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
            <p>I would definitely say the time frame. If these classes were 18 weeks instead of 8 week I feel like it'd make learning easier and let the students understand more topics of interest.</p>

            <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
            <p>Yes, I expected to learn more about CSS and I did</p>

            <h2>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h2>
            <p>I learned grids, floats, typography, and Bootstrap. I encountered Bootstrap during COMP001A but I did not use it because I did not understand it completely.</p>
